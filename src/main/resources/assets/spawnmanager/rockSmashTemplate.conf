# Stone types can be Pixelmon's tumblestone blocks. Otherwise, shit like "minecraft:cobblestone" would be fine
# Stone-Types is optional. IF STONE-TYPES IS NOT PRESENT OR EMPTY, IT WILL ASSUME ANY.
# If using Pixelmon's Rock Smash system, stone types is assumed (and forced, due to a limitation in Pixelmon's system vs my system) to be "Any"
# Example stone type list: "minecraft:cobblestone, pixelmon:black_tumblestone" etc etc
# You can also put custom Pixelmon entities as stone types. Say I add a Pokemon I named "CustomRock", I would put it as a stone type like so: "Stone-Types"="pixelmon:customrock" and it would fire off a statue of that Pokemon
