# If using Pixelmon's Headbutt system, wood types is assumed (and forced, due to a limitation in Pixelmon's system vs my system) to be "Any"
# Example wood type list: "minecraft:oak_log, minecraft:spruce_log" etc etc
# You can also put custom Pixelmon entities as wood types. Say I add a Pokemon I named "CustomTree", I would put it as a wood type like so: "Wood-Types"="pixelmon:customtree" and it would fire off a statue of that Pokemon
